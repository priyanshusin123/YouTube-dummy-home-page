HTML:
The page has a header section with a logo and a search bar.
There's a main-content div that contains the video player and a sidebar with thumbnail images for other videos.
Clicking on a thumbnail in the sidebar changes the video in the main player.
CSS:
Basic styling is applied for layout, colors, and responsiveness.
The header has a red background (like YouTube's real logo) and the main content is flexed into two parts: the video player and the sidebar.
JavaScript:
The changeVideo function takes a video ID and updates the src of the iframe to display the corresponding YouTube video.
How It Works:
When you click on a thumbnail, the video changes in the iframe by updating the video ID.
You can easily add more video thumbnails or style it further for responsiveness and interactivity.
